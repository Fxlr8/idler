# Idler, the app that does exactly nothing

## Install depencencies
```
npm install
```

## Start dev environment
```
npm run dev
```

Copy local IP with port from the output to the `capacitor.config.ts` `server.url` section
```

That will start the preview of an IOS device. You can now edit code and it will auto reload the preview
